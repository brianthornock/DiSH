# DiSH
A Digitally Controlled Sample/Hold Effect

Based on the 70's effect by Maestro, the DiSH uses the main filter portion of the FSH-1 and uses a programmed ATTINY85 chip to do the random voltage generation. This allows for modern features including:

 - Tap Tempo
 - Tempo multipliers
 - Manual adjustment to the tap tempo speed
 - Tempo patterns for cool, rhythmic effects

Included here are code for programming the ATTINY85 via the Arduino IDE, Gerber layout files, and build documentation.
